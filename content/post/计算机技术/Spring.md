# Spring

The Spring Framework is divided into modules. Applications can choose which modules they need.

 At the heart are the modules of the **core container**, including **a configuration model** and **a dependency injection mechanism**. 

Beyond that, the Spring Framework provides foundational support for different application architectures, including messaging, transactional data and persistence, and web. It also includes the Servlet-based Spring MVC web framework and, in parallel, the Spring WebFlux reactive web framework.

## Spring与JavaEE

Spring并不拥抱JavaEE标准，但是选择性的实现了其中几个独立的标准。
